# Decentralized File Storage and Sharing using Ethereum Blockchain

In this project we use the Swarm and Whisper protocols defined by Ethereum to develop a decentralized application for file storage and messaging.

## Protocols
- Swarm: Shards and encrypts file into multiple chunks and replicates it across various nodes connected with hashing keys
- Whisper: Peer-to-Peer decentralized messaging protocol with no data stored in a centralized server.
